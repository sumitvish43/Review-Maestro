# Getting Started with this Project

Setup backend environment for python to run a server. Explore this for virtual environment setup: (https://mothergeo-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/how-to/venv-win.html)

Once the server is running, start your frontend development server by following below guidelines.

# Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

Node.js (version 10 or above)
npm (Node Package Manager)

# Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Open a terminal and navigate to the project's Frontend directory.

Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

npm install

# Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server and view the application in your browser.
Development Server
To start the development server, run the following command:

npm start

This will launch the application and open it in your default browser. The development server supports hot reloading, so any changes you make to the source code will be immediately reflected in the browser.

# Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

npm run build
This will generate a optimized and minified version of the application in the dist directory. You can then deploy this version to a web server or hosting platform.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
